# Infinite Tic Tac Toe

A dynamic and fun twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game! Players can make moves beyond the traditional game rules, with a limited number of moves allowed on the board at any time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Players can only keep their last 3 moves on the board, allowing for an evolving strategy.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to any screen size and centers beautifully.
- **Stylish UI**: A clean and modern interface with interactive elements.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on cells to place their mark (`X` or `O`).
3. Each player can only have their most recent 3 moves on the board.
4. The game checks for a winner after every move, following classic Tic Tac Toe rules:
   - Horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows of 3 matching symbols.
5. The first player to align 3 of their symbols wins the game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive layout.
